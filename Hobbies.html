    <p class="intro">
        First off, when it came to choosing someone for this project to interview the subject that I chose was my first and only choice. The person I selected is Ivy Leatherman. We were sort of coworkers at Lincoln Middle School in East St Louis, IL. I was the technology technician assigned to the school and Ivy was/is an 8th grade math teacher.     </p>

    <p>
        I found Ivy interesting because when I first visited her room it was during lunch period, and I noticed she had a Minecraft lunch box. I thought to myself, “hmm she’s a little nerdy and so am I.” So, I needed to know more about her.     </p>

    <p>
        Over time she would submit tickets for mostly broken Chromebooks (sigh), but we would always have small talk during my visits. During our chats I discovered that she was an engineer and in my opinion a math genius. I believe we became friends because we shared interests in aeronautics. She told me that when she graduated college, she landed a job at Boeing in St. Louis as an engineer and I use to work there also, so we would discuss our time there, which was mostly bad for me, but I digress.     </p>

    <p>
        I also learned about her love for photography. On Ivy’s free time she does free lance photography. She also does the yearbook for Lincoln Middle School every year. So, during every event, homecoming, Halloween and graduation she takes photos to be placed in the yearbook.     </p>

    <p>
        It took a lot of convincing to get her to agree to this project, but of all the people I know she is top 3 on the most interesting list.
