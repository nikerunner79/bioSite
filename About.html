        <p>Ivy Leatherman is an 8th grade math teacher at Lincoln Middle School in East St. Louis, IL. She was born on December 31, 1971, in East St Louis, IL.  Her father was a sergeant in the US Navy, so she lived in a few different places, Pensacola, Fl, Chicago, IL, and East St. Louis, IL. Her mother was a elementary school teacher so that’s where she got her love teaching.
            As a child Ivy wanted to be a pediatrician doctor. She attended Tennessee State University and obtained a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering.  After college Ivy found a career with Boeing in St. Louis, MO working as an engineer. After a few years of working there Ivy felt something was missing from her life or perhaps she was not in the career she was destined to be in. So, she decided to pursue a Masters in Elementary Education so she could become an educator. After completing her master’s she landed the job in Cahokia, IL is a English teacher, but later landed a job as math teacher at Lincoln Middle School.
